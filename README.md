   - Import the provided SQL file into your SQL database management system.
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the root folder of the project.
3. **Run the Application**:
   - Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
   - In the terminal, run the following command:
